								<h2 class="major">The Why</h2>
								<div class="content span-7">
									<p>At Mirror Mirror, we understand that, for many of us, texting is one of the main ways we process our emotions. It is one of the few instances where we write down our thoughts, and it gives us a chance to acknowledge them and keep a record of them. Only a few of us take the time to contend with our emotions and process them on our own time, alone. Instead of “wasting” time journaling, people take the most convenient route and avoid their emotions altogether. So many of us have adopted a lifestyle that facilitates compartmentalizing, or worse, engaging with emotions in actively unhealthy ways. Whether you are overwhelmed by your breakup, the approaching finals season, or just a bad hair day, taking the time to consider your thoughts, emotions, and headspace regularly makes it easier to deal with what you really feel. Yet, there are pertinent limitations to using texting someone as our only outlet: it can be unhealthy and stressful to constantly unpack your problems with friends and family; it can be daunting to make yourself vulnerable with another person to share thoughts/emotions; and sometimes not receiving the response you expect can feel lonely/even more invalidating. </p>
